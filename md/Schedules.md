# Schedules

* Every team plays their division twice and out of division once.

* The schedule is done identically to the previous year starting in 2020.

* Starting in 2024 the schedule will follow the same matchup sequence: ![Schedule](https://cdn.glitch.global/0835553c-8dce-4cb7-895c-324a6fac846e/Screen%20Shot%202024-07-15%20at%2010.19.52%20PM.png?v=1721096521438)

## Reasoning

* Since we reward a playoff spot to each division champion, we feel it's best to play your division more often than other teams.
* It works out nicely with the amount of weeks in the NFL schedule (14 regular season games).
* The identical part is mainly from a logistical point of view. It's HARD to set the schedule up each year to make sure it fits the parameters above. It looks easy on the surface but it comes down to drawing pairing charts and it's just a pain. We had a blip in 2019 with out of conference games appearing when they shouldn't have so we didn't want to repeat that (it got fixed in the end but caused a slightly out of whack schedule for a couple of weeks). So everything was corrected for the 2020 season- it's good- it's just going to be copied into the next season and such going forth unless something changes (NFL adding more games or something like that).
* The identical schedule also addresses any concerns of the schedule maker creating the schedule to benefit what teams they play what weeks. I can assure you I, the commissioner, do NOT do that to begin with, but understand why some could think somebody with that power would do it. By doing the same exact schedule each year it's impossible to swap teams into more advantageous weeks for certain teams so it should not be of any concern.
