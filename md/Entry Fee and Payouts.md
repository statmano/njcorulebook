# Entry Fee and Payouts

* The league entry fee is $150 per team.

* All entry fees must be in by the start of the playoffs (Week 15).

* Any overdue/late entry fees will be handled privately between the Commissioner (Sean O) and Treasurer (Tony) and the team involved.

* Payouts are done on a 60/30/10 Split so:
1st = $1,080
2nd = $540
3rd = $180
4th = A hug

* There is a league trophy and each winner gets their name added to a placard around the base.

## Reasoning

* The entry fee moved to $150 to both keep people interested but not be too expensive that teams can't pay it/cause financial stress or too large that it encourages potential collusion. This is up for review on a yearly basis.
* Payment deadline is before the playoffs because we aren't doing anything with the money (investing or anything like that) so it doesn't make sense to have to tie it up for months at a time. The later date also allows teams to save up for it if needed. We just want to make sure the money is there to pay the winners when the final standings are determined.
* Overdue and late entries are handled privately because we're all friends in this league- yes we want to make sure the winners get paid and in a timely manner, but we also aren't out to embarass or hurt anybody in the process. These types of things are best kept in private. If you can't make the payment deadline or have any other circumstances that effect it, please contact the commissioner (Sean O) directly.
* Payout splits are that way to reward better performances greater. The 1st/2nd splits are to recognize both places as a job well done, the 3rd split is basically just giving their money back plus a tiny reward, and the 4th split is just plain sympathy. Sucks you finished with nothing in the end :) - These aren't locked in stone for future years and up for debate.
* League trophy is technically still needed a slight refurbishment but should be ready shortly.
