# Rosters

### Rosters are made up of the following:
1 QB
1 RB
1 WR
1 TE
3 Flex (WR/RBs)
1 DEF
8 Bench

* Waivers are done on a rolling basis. All non-rostered players are put on waivers upon the start of their game for that week and come off on Wednesday morning (around 3am EST, depends on when Yahoo processes them). All dropped players that have been rostered for at least a day are put on waivers for two calendar days.

* Can't cut list provided by Yahoo!

* ALL Teams are LOCKED upon the end of Week 14 (usually done sometime after the Monday night game kicks off as players are already on waivers by that point).

## Reasoning

* Reflect an actual NFL roster (sans kicker [see below]). Yes this technically is one extra FLEX position than what you would see on an actual field, the reason for this was the original league had three flexes in its default setup and we just never changed it, it's close enough and not insane stuff like 2 QBs.
* No kickers as they were too unpredictable on a weekly and yearly basis. With the amount of points they could score too they were still a major factor in who wins a matchup and we didn't want matchups to come down to random luck.
* Eight bench spots originally came from the coronavirus pandemic of 2020. This was to allow more flexibility in rosters should a higher than normal amount of players miss games due to COVID-19. This then continued the following year as COVID stuck around and has become the default standard. 
* Team defenses instead of Individual Defense Players (IDP) are for simplicity. This is up for debate though as some feel that team defenses are either too hard to score properly or, like kickers, too inconsistent. Debatable.
* Roster size has a direct impact of how plentiful the waiver wire/free agent pool is, we all feel this is a good balance to keep that active and not stagnant or hyper flooded with talent.
* Waivers are used in the manner they are to prevent "fastest to a computer" competitions when it comes to picking up players.
* If a player is added and then dropped, but has not for an entire day, they are not placed on waivers and become a free agent. This is a default setting by Yahoo! to prevent teams from "blocking" others from picking up players in a timely manner.
* The locking of all teams is for multiple reasons. The first is to prevent non-playoff teams from messing with the outcome of the playoffs by picking up or dropping players. If you are not in the playoffs, your season is done- you can't improve anything for next season, you can only mess things up (for yourself or for others). Also we play with a mindset of "this is the team you assembled, you ride with it going forward". We don't want a team stealing away a championship because they were able to pickup a recently injured stud-player's backup during Championship week. You had a whole year to build your roster.
