# Draft

* The draft is typically done the weekend as close to the start of the football season (typically Labor day weekend).

* The draft is a snake draft (1-12, 12-1, 1-12, ...)

* The draft is LIVE and done online through Yahoo!

* We allow trading of draft picks (they must even out so every team has the same number of picks in the draft).

## Reasoning

* Timing is because we want to minimize the chance of a team drafting a player to only see them get injured before the season even starts. The closer we can make it to opening night, the better.
* Timing also allows the most amount of information to be available to teams to use. This includes depth charts, preseason performance, contract holdouts, etc.
* The draft is a snake draft because, well the league voted on it prior to the 2019 season. This has gone back and forth through the years, but for now it is a snake draft. If any changes do occur to this it will be for the FOLLOWING season and not the CURRENT UPCOMING season as we have traded draft picks that were made assuming it would be a certain style of draft.
* We do a live draft for efficiency. We don't want to be waiting around for long periods of time for somebody to make picks.
* We do the draft online because we tried doing a live in-person draft one time (2006) and it was just very hard to manage, people didn't know who was still available, we were cramped in one room, and they tend to take FOREVER to complete. We can still have in-person drafts, but everything is to be done online (so make sure there is good wifi available!).
* Trading of draft picks adds an additioanl element to trading AND gives out of the running teams at least a chance to improve their team the following year. This also tends to make playoff teams STACKED, which can be more fun to watch instead of rooting for a WR to get only 3 catches for 15 yards.
