# League Members

* We are a 12-team league split into three divisons of four (4).
* Every current league member is available to rejoin the following year as long as they haven't done anything egregious like colluding, reprehensible behavior to league members, or any other gross misconduct (i.e. cheating in some way).
* If a league member does want to leave the league there are no hard feelings, life happens. This is ultimately a fun league between friends with a little stakes to keep things interesting. We do ask that you do your best in letting us know as early as possible so we can make the proper adjustments before the next season starts. If a league member does want out, we always allow two days before actually executing the removal and starting a replacement search.
* Dead Teams: A team that fails to field a full starting lineup for two (2) weeks during the same season is considered a dead team. The commissioner will lock the owner from the team decide if it is most fair to either a) insert the best projected roster for the following games or b) remove all players from the starting roster for the remaining games depending on the timing and future schedule. (see reasonin for further info)
Exceptions: The owner is actively trying to NOT LOSE a game (for example if they don't want negative points from a defense)
OR The owner is jeopardizing future losses due to roster constraints (not worth dropping a bye week starter for a one-week replacement)
* Replacement members are always discussed amongst all league members before being selected.

## Reasoning

* A 12-team league provides a good balance of the distribution of players. Every team will not be loaded with talent to where roster moves and trades aren't needed, but also the league isn't so thin that a team with just one game-changer can dominate a schedule versus watered down competition.
* It's a friendly league in the end so we'd like everybody involved to come back to play year after year. It also creates fun rivalries and a history to look back on.
* We give an owner one "fault" for not fielding a full lineup as hey, sometimes things happen. Late injury announcements, out of town/on vacation, life just happens. It isn't a huge commitment to check your lineup and phones work almost everywhere, yes- but we'll still grant one exception. A double-fault shows that you no longer care and we want this league to remain competitive for the fairness of all members.
* Starting lineups after the removal of a dead-team. Basically it is still pretty variable, but best practices that will most likely be followed are based upon "What is the most FAIR to the remaining teams on the schedule". If the dead-period happened during the out-of-division weeks and the dead-team is out of playoff contention, we'll most likely start optimal projected lineups going forward as the lost games didn't effect division standings. If the dead-period occurred and the dead-team WON those games, optimal lineups will be inserted. If the dead-period occurred in a way that gave an unfair advantage of "free wins" to the opposing teams within the division, then the remaining teams should also get "free wins" and the roster will be emptied. THERE MAY BE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE- Especially if the dead-team was doing great and it has implications on the Wild Card... we will discuss as a league at that point what is most fair.
* For the discussion part of the replacement member- we want to make sure all league members have a chance to be heard on who they think is the best option to move forward with.
