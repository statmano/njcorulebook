# Keepers

* We do OPTIONAL keepers (max of 2 per team).

* This means you have the OPTION to keep 2, 1, or NONE of your players from the previous season prior to the draft.

### If you decide to keep:
* Two Players - You MUST own at least two picks in the first two rounds for that season.
* One Player - You MUST have at least a 1st OR 2nd round draft pick for that season.
* NONE - It doesn't matter if you have any picks in the first two rounds (you could've traded them away), but if you DO have them, you get to use them as actual picks from the draft pool in the draft.  
* Keeper slots will always default to your latest picks in the first two rounds, so if you have one first and two seconds for example, your keepers will be chosen using your two second round picks.

## Reasoning

* Keepers add a strategic element to the game.
* Keepers add a sense of continuity and identity to the league.
* The max of two keepers is to keep a competitive balance to the league to where one team cannot be a juggernaut dynasty for years and years with other owners not being able to compete with.
* The optional keeper aspect was brought into the league to give the teams left with very bare rosters a shot at being competitive the following season. This is to both keep team owners in the league (because who wants to play with crappy rosters) and to also encourage more high stakes trades to occur.
* The keeer slots section is strictly for simplicity. The process can be a bit of a learning curve to start with and we don't want to make things any more complex by saying that the picks MUST be the teams original picks, or if an owner traded away their 2nd round pick but THEN traded back for a different one later that they can't keep anybody or anything of that complicated nature. If you have picks in the first two rounds, it's your latest picks- that's it.
