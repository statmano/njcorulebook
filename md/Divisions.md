# Divisons

* The top three (3) teams from the previous season draft their divisions in a reverse non-snake order (i.e. 3-2-1, 3-2-1, 3-2-1)

## Reasoning

* This gives even more incentive to finishing "in the money"
* Balances out division strength as the #1 team from the previous year, theoretically, should have the hardest division the following season
* Ignites a friendly layer of trash talk
