# Trades

* All trades are execute instantly, without any waiting period/veto period. A trade will only be reversed if there is clear and obvious collusion present. This is reserved for extreme situations (which hopefully we will not have as every owner should be in this to perform their best, whether it is the current season or future seasons).

* Trade Deadline is the Saturday BEFORE the start of Week 11's Sunday games.

## Reasoning

* To allow managers instant access to players. This allows managers to use players right away, no awkward "Are they available this week?" questions, and can make other roster adjustments without something pending potentially preventing them.
* Nobody knows the future. What may appear to look like a lopsided trade when first made may work out very differently in the end.
* To curb any "spite" vetos, where an owner may think a trade is fair, but vetos because they want to harm one of the teams involved.
* Each manager should be acting within their best ability to win or to setup themselves to win the following season. 
* "Big Boy Pants"- we all wear them. There is no reason anybody should be "protected" by another league member, they make their own decisions for their own team.
* Prevent "Late Vultures"- We saw countless times in the past where trades were vetoed simply because an outside team didn't know one of the teams involved was open to trading a certain player... so they would veto the trade just so they can offer up something better themselves. This causes massive friction as the original team feels that they are not only shortchanged because they end up getting nothing (or having to offer more), but also that they did all of the initial work for a vulture to come in and steal the player. If you want to make a trade, you put in the work, if you snooze... you lose.
* Trade deadline time is not too early as we want to allow teams to figure out if they have a shot at making the playoffs or not, but also not too late to where teams rosters change drastically right before the playoffs. This is debatable still and not set in stone for future years.
