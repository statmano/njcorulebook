# Playoffs

### Playoffs consist of four (4) teams:
* Three division champions (tiebreaker = season points)
* The highest season scoring non-division champ (Wild Card)

* The #1 overall seed by record (tiebreaker = season points) gets to CHOOSE who they want to play in the first round of the playoffs. This is to be announced by the Tuesday after Week 14.

## Reasoning

* Playoffs make the regular season more exciting than just straight record.
* Four teams is 1/4 (25%) of the league, which is a reward for a top team in the league but isn't too spread thin that non-worthy teams make it (and could get lucky and still win it all in cheap fashion). You EARN your way into it.
* Division rivalries are fun, encourage trades, and keep teams involved.
* Tiebreakers are done with season points as teams have much more control over that end result than they do over a random schedule (which effects division record) or other event.
* Wildcard is regardless of record so nobody can say they got "screwed by the schedule". 
* Picking your opponent is both a reward to hopefully choose the easiest path but also adds some fun drama to the situation as well. Plus when you have three division champs and a wildcard who has scored a bunch of points, how should the seeding take place? Record-wise? But then the #1 seed could be facing a juggernaut wildcard team that just had an extra tough schedule. Points-wise? But then you risk pitting the #1 seed against a team that may not have HUGE weeks but is more consistent with their scoring than a yo-yo-ing wildcard who blows the doors off certain weeks but is very beatable the next. This just makes it easier in the end.
