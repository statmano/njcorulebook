# Scoring

* For a full breakdown of point scoring please check the settings page on the league homepage. (Otherwise it's a lot to type)

* Fractional points

* .5 points per reception

* We do not allow non-QB players to collect points when playing as a full-time QB. Exclusions to this are trick plays, special goal-line packages, or wild-cat type plays.

## Reasoning

* Some of the scoring is from way back when the league was first started. We have kept it this way because there wasn't a huge issue with it, this is why our Passing TDs are worth 6 points, INTs -3 points, and Passing Yards are 30 points. These are up for debate if somebody wants to.
* Rushing and receiving yards were dropped to 10 yards a point to help level the playing field between a team with a stacked QB vs other teams (as QBs were scoring much higher than other positions). Positions ARE relative to their own alternatives, yes... but the ultimate decision that it came down to was that an all-time/stud performance for a postion (think Peyton Manning's 7 TD, Jimmy Smith Wk 2 in 2000, or Doug Martin's monster 2012 game) should be close to each other.
* Fractional points were to avoid ties and also landmarks suuuuuucked (especially when you were a yard short).
* .5 per reception was brought in to bring WRs value up a bit as they are typically used less. We were a really heavy on the RB league prior to doing so. But also it's a skill to catch a ball, so it should be rewarded.
* Defensive scoring has been paired down to pretty much points allowed contributing to the bulk of the score. We used to include sacks... and then tackles for loss (because they are the same thing basically, one just includes a QB), but Yahoo! couldn't count them properly (they wouldn't count combined TFL's, what the hell!?!?). So we cut out those, we kept turnover and we still do have defensive TDs which can skew a score pretty big, but this is debatable if we want to keep. Hasn't been a dealbreaker yet though.
* The non-QB rule is for situations in which a player like Taysom Hill has started as a full-time QB, which creates an unfair advantage (especially at a low-scoring position like TE). This probably won't happen again as the only times in recent history have been with Taysom Hill and COVID related debacles like the Denver Broncos had in 2020.
